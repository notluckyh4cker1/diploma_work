# Diploma Work
Analog seismograms (10): a program for working with heavy rasters (using the OpenGL graphics library).

## Main functions:
1. Loading heavy rasters (~500 MB) from BMP, TIFF, PNG, JPG formats.
2. Correction of raster parameters (dimensions, resolution), if they are not specified in the format.
3. Manipulation of rasters (zooming, moving the viewing area to any part, 2D rotation, splitting into parts, joining parts, cropping uninformative edges).
4. Superimposing a time scale with an uneven (graphically editable) step and adjustable corrections of boundary values.
5. Manual vectorization with simultaneous overlay of several curves of different colors on the raster.
